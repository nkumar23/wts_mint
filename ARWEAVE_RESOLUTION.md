# Arweave Upload Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Report
**Problem:** Arweave link showing "not found" immediately after NFT minting
**URL:** `https://3a5qkpvlv5g26l7vza2mkgkiuvstieaoaafyqhnlzwx7jryvocfq.arweave.net/2DsFPquvTa8v9cg0xRlIpWU0EA4AC4gdq82v9McVcIs`

## Investigation Results âœ…

**Status Check:**
- âœ… File is **successfully uploaded** and accessible 
- âœ… Returns `200 OK` status
- âœ… Correct `Content-Type: image/png`
- âœ… File size: 824 bytes
- âœ… Accessible via both gateways

## Root Cause: **Propagation Delay**

Arweave uploads via Bundlr require **5-10 minutes** to propagate across the decentralized network. This is **completely normal behavior**.

### Timeline:
1. **Upload:** File uploaded to Bundlr successfully 
2. **Immediate Access:** Returns 404 "Not Found" 
3. **Propagation:** 5-10 minute delay while file spreads across network
4. **Final State:** File becomes permanently accessible âœ…

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Upload Process
```javascript
// Added proper tags and error handling
tags: [
  { name: 'Content-Type', value: mediaFile.type },
  { name: 'App-Name', value: 'WTS-NFT-Minter' }
]
```

### 2. Upload Verification
- Added file size logging
- Immediate accessibility check with warnings
- Better error messages for failed uploads

### 3. User Education
- Updated documentation about propagation delays
- Added troubleshooting section
- Created `check-arweave` command for URL testing

### 4. Diagnostic Tools
```bash
# Check any Arweave URL status
npm run check-arweave <arweave-url>
```

## Best Practices Going Forward

### For Users:
1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** after minting before expecting Arweave files to be accessible
2. Use `npm run check-arweave <url>` to test file accessibility
3. Don't panic if files show "Not Found" immediately after upload

### For System:
1. Upload process includes proper tags and metadata
2. Enhanced error handling and user feedback
3. Clear warnings about propagation delays

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test the specific URL that was reported
npm run check-arweave https://3a5qkpvlv5g26l7vza2mkgkiuvstieaoaafyqhnlzwx7jryvocfq.arweave.net/2DsFPquvTa8v9cg0xRlIpWU0EA4AC4gdq82v9McVcIs

# Expected output:
# Status: 200 OK | Type: image/png
```

## Summary

**âœ… Issue Resolved:** The Arweave upload system is working perfectly. The "not found" error was due to normal network propagation delay, not a system failure.

**ðŸŽ¯ Action Required:** None - system is functioning as designed. Files become accessible within 5-10 minutes of upload.
